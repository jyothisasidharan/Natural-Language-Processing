# Introduction to Natural Language Processing (NLP)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is an **Introduction to Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, designed to help beginners understand fundamental NLP concepts, workflows and practical implementations. It covers essential preprocessing steps, basic text analytics and hands-on experience with common NLP tasks.

The goal is to provide a foundation for more advanced NLP projects such as sentiment analysis, topic modeling and deep learning–based language models.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Understand how to preprocess and clean raw text data.
* Explore tokenization, stopword removal, stemming and lemmatization.
* Perform basic text feature extraction (Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF).
* Build simple NLP models for classification or analysis.
* Evaluate model performance using standard metrics.

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

* **Python**
* **NumPy & Pandas** – Data handling
* **NLTK / spaCy** – Text preprocessing
* **Scikit‑learn** – Modeling and feature extraction
* **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – Visualizations
